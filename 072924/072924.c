Lab 3: Week-3: Basics of Socket Programming
• Coverage
1. Basics of Socket Programming.
2. Details of Connection less Socket programming APIs for TCP/IP stack using 
C.
• Assignments
1. Write a sender and receiver program in C by passing the IP address and the 
port number of each other through the command line arguments using 
connection less socket. Both of them will exchange messages with each other 
continuously. If any one of them will receive the “exit” message from the 
other end then both of them will close the connection. (Assume both the client
